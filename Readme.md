Homework - Week 8 - Thursday
Posted by Tim Whitacre on Jul 24

Create an application that utilizes Parse.User and user associations and allow for the following:

1. New User Signup
2. User Log In/ Log Out
3. User Persistence -> if a user is logged in, route to a new view
4. Show specific user content

You can continue to use the blog you were working on last week and add user capabilities to it, or you can create a smaller app like a todo list that has this capability.

This should be deployed to Heroku or GH Pages when you are done and fully functional. Also, it should look nice.
